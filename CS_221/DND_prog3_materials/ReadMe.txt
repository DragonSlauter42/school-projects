This zip file contains the following files:

ReadMe.txt - The text file you are reading now.

GameGraph.h - The header file defining the Room structure and the GameGraph class.

Snippets.txt - A text file containing two functions you can use in your GameGraph.cpp file.

gamelayout.txt - The text file defining the game graph.  Use this for testing your program.
	Note: The instructor will be using a different gamelayout.txt file for testing but it
	will follow the same format of 20 rooms.

cmd.txt - A sample commands file you can use for testing your program using I/O redirection.
	Note: You must be able to run your program using I/O redirection and this file.  The
	cmd.txt file that the instructor will use for testing is not the same as this file.

Prog4.txt - This is actually a demonstration executable file of program 4.  To run
	the program change the ".txt" extension to ".exe".  You can run the program without
	using cmd.txt just by double clicking the .exe file to run it.  If you want to use
	I/O redirection you will have to open a DOS prompt window and CD to the executable,
	then use the command line:  Prog4 < cmd.txt

GameMain.cpp - This is the instructor's main function that will be used to test your program 4.
	You may use it in developing your code.

SprintReport_P4.docx - The sprint report form to be filled out and returned with your
	source code. (MS Word format)
